Questions about Java\

1. One question I had about java was is it the most powerful language compared to the rest? I know that AI uses a lot of java based coding and that is because it is very open and isn\'92t limited like some of the other languages. The reason I ask this question is because I am curious to know which languages will eventually become obsolete and one day we might have a completely new language or remain with the ones we have now. Does java have the capability to adapt to what we might need from it in the future?\

2. Another question I had was  we used an instance initializer and I was wondering if that was really necessary or were we just using it for this lab particularly. I just felt like I could have a used a constructor which is something we learned a lot more about in C++ and other languages so I was just wondering did we really need an instance initializer or could this project also be done with constructors?\

3. We did all this using all these different files and inheritance but I am wondering would it be possible to do it all in one file? \

4. In this project we were working a lot in the base class and we were using interfaces to help with that. But I was wondering is that the best method to handle them when some of the types aren\'92t in the same base class?}
